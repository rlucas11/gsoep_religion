# Issues
- Effect sizes
  - Authors focus on the fact that lagged effects should be much smaller than cross-sectional correlations. However, they do not describe these correlations.
  - The primary argument for the importance of small effects is that they accumulate or that small effects can be consequential when the outcome is important (e.g., life or death). 
  - Neither argument holds in this case if the cross-sectional correlations aren't large
- Model complexity
  - The primary model focuses on latent traits with item-level indicators. There are many constraints and lots of cross-loadings. 
  - The model does not fit particularly well. The authors defend the models despite this poor fit by referring to the model complexity. However, the model could fit poorly for other reasons.
    - We can test this by looking at simpler versions of these models, including single-trait models or models that use observed variables rather than latent variables. 
  - All models enter all traits simultaneously. This affects model interpretation and an argument can be made that not controlling for traits is more appropriate. We can test to see whether this matters
- Problems with the CLPM
  - The CLPM is rarely justifiable and can lead to spurious results
  - The size of the lagged effects could easily emerge spuriously, given prior simulations
  - Can test whether these variables look like they have an autoregressive structure (they do not)
  
# Results
## Correlations between aggregated mean scores across all waves of data
## Run models that cross the following characteristics
- CLPM versus RI-CLPM
- Observed variables versus latent traits
- Single trait versus all traits
